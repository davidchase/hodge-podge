A checkout flow for the browser. w/a [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) medium.

Getting Started
---------------
`npm i` will install all dev dependencies to `node_modules` dir.

`npm i -g nodemon` will globally install a nice watcher for a hapi development.

Then you can do something like `nodemon --watch client server.js`
this will watch the `client` dir and `server.js` file for changes.
